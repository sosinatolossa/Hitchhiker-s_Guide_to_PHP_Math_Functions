# Hitchhiker-s_Guide_to_PHP_Math_Functions

Each step of the project provides a math operation that can be completed using built-in PHP functions. Use the documentation to find them and apply them correctly to get the answer.

###Functions

1. We have given you an $initial value to start from as an octal string. (octal is a base 8 system of notation, instead of the likely more familiar decimal base 10 system).

Using the PHP Documentation, find a PHP function to convert this octal string to a decimal number.

Sometimes it might be easier to use your favorite search engine to locate the right page within the PHP documentation.

Save the result in a variable $a. Throughout this project, print your result at each step and check it against the hint. Be sure to add a newline at the end of each print statement.

2. The value of $a is a number of degrees. Use a PHP function to convert it to radians and store the result in a new variable, $b.
3. Use a built-in PHP function to take the cosine of $b and store it in a new variable, $c.
4. Use a built-in PHP function to round $c to 3 decimal places and store the result in a new variable, $d.
5. Find a PHP function to take the natural log of $d and store the result in a new variable, $e.
6. Use a PHP function to take the absolute value of $e and store it in $f.
7. Use a PHP function to take the inverse, or arc cosine of $f and store the result in $g.
8. $g is a number in radians. Use a PHP function to convert this to a number of degrees and store it as $h.
9. Use a PHP function to floor (round down) $h and store the result in $i.
10. Subtract 47 from $i to arrive at the solution, $j.
